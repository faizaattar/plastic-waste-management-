            <h2>Why Reduce Plastic Waste?</h2>
            <p>Plastic waste is a major environmental issue because it takes hundreds of years to decompose, leading to significant pollution in our oceans and landfills. The accumulation of plastic waste harms wildlife, as animals can ingest or become entangled in plastic debris, often with fatal consequences. Additionally, plastic production and disposal contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change. By reducing plastic waste, we can minimize environmental pollution, protect marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and decrease our carbon footprint, fostering a healthier planet for future generations.</p>
